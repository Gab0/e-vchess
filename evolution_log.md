-> No more 'clone the best' on regular arena evolution process.
-> Added param_parallelcheck.
-> Locked 'param_evalmethod' to 0.
-> Traded off the messy first encarnation of thinkinterate method for a more clear one. Dumped off 'param_aperture' method in favour of full movelist iteration.
-> Deprecated many parameters like 'param_seekatk' & 'param_seekpieces'
-> Added Alpha-Beta prunning scheme. Going past DEEP 3 was impossible because of the thinking time involved.
-> param_aperture deprecated in favour of AB pruning.
-> Proper move ordering before iteration, so to help the AB prunning.
